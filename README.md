# Urgent Care Management
## This project was done as part of Software Engineering Project. This repository contains my attempt to integrate frontend-backend-Database

Used handlebars template engine for populating the backend data in the frontend HTML files. <br>
Used MySQL as a Database for storing Data of the actors and their respective collections of data (like appointments, doctor names, insurance details, lab technicians and administrator) <br>
Database was hosted on AWS. <br>
**Technologies used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS. <br>
**Authentication:** Used bcryptJS to hash the passwords and JWT for authentication.<br>

## The final implementation can be found at the following link: https://github.com/utkarshjha1994/Urgent_Care
