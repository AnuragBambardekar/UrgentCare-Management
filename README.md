# Urgent Care Management
## This project was done as part of Software Engineering Project. This repository contains my attempt to integrate frontend-backend-Database

Used handlebars template engine for populating the backend data in the frontend HTML files.
Used MySQL as a Database for storing Data of the actors and their respective collections of data (like appointments, doctor names, insurance details, lab technicians and administrator) 
**Technologies used:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS. 
**Authentication:** Used bcryptJS to hash the passwords and JWT for authentication.

##The final implementation can be found at the following link: https://github.com/utkarshjha1994/Urgent_Care
